    "**Eager Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Eager mode evaluates operations immediatley and return concrete values immediately. To enable eager mode simply place `tf.enable_eager_execution()` at the top of your code. We recommend using eager execution when prototyping as it is intuitive, easier to debug, and requires less boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph mode is TensorFlow's default execution mode (although it will change to eager with TF 2.0). In graph mode operations only produce a symbolic graph which doesn't get executed until run within the context of a tf.Session(). This style of coding is less inutitive and has more boilerplate, however it can lead to performance optimizations and is particularly suited for distributing training across multiple devices. We recommend using delayed execution for performance sensitive production code. "
